## Aim: To study and implement the concepts of searching algorithms and their applications in C++.

## Apparatus: VS Code or Online C++ Compiler

## Theory:

**Searching Algorithms** are fundamental algorithms used to locate specific elements within data structures. They are essential building blocks in computer science for data retrieval, database operations, and information processing. Understanding different searching techniques helps in choosing the most efficient approach based on data organization and performance requirements.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Search Operation**: The process of finding a particular element in a collection of data.
   ```cpp
   int search(int arr[], int size, int target) {
       // Search logic implementation
       return index; // or -1 if not found
   }
   ```

2. **Search Key**: The element or value being searched for in the data structure.
   ```cpp
   int target = 10;  // This is our search key
   ```

3. **Search Space**: The collection of elements where the search operation is performed.
   ```cpp
   int arr[] = {5, 3, 8, 4, 2};  // This is our search space
   ```

4. **Time Complexity**: The measure of efficiency in terms of operations required relative to input size.

### Searching Algorithm Categories:

```cpp
// Basic search pattern
int search_algorithm(data_structure, search_key) {
    // Implementation specific to algorithm
    if (element_found) {
        return position;
    }
    return -1; // Not found
}
```

### Types of Searching:

1. **Linear/Sequential Search**: Examines elements one by one from start to end
2. **Binary Search**: Divides search space in half repeatedly (requires sorted data)
3. **Hash-based Search**: Uses hash functions for direct access
4. **Tree-based Search**: Utilizes tree structures for hierarchical searching
5. **Interpolation Search**: Estimates position based on key value distribution
6. **Jump Search**: Skips elements in fixed intervals then performs linear search

### Algorithm Characteristics:

- **Input Requirements**: Whether data needs to be sorted or can be unsorted
- **Time Complexity**: Best, average, and worst-case performance
- **Space Complexity**: Additional memory requirements
- **Stability**: Whether relative order of equal elements is preserved
- **Adaptability**: Performance with different data distributions

### Benefits of Efficient Searching:

- **Fast Data Retrieval**: Quick access to required information
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient query processing in databases
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced computational overhead
- **Scalability**: Better performance with large datasets
- **User Experience**: Faster response times in applications
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduced CPU and memory usage

### Search Algorithm Selection Criteria:

- **Data Size**: Number of elements in the dataset
- **Data Organization**: Whether data is sorted or unsorted
- **Search Frequency**: How often searches are performed
- **Memory Constraints**: Available memory for algorithm execution
- **Preprocessing Overhead**: Cost of organizing data before searching

## Programs:

### 1. Linear Search Algorithm

---

**File:** `Linear_search.cpp`  
**Experiment ID:** SEARCH-01

**Description:** Implements the simplest searching algorithm that examines each element sequentially from the beginning until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached. This algorithm works on both sorted and unsorted arrays.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Initialize:** Start from the first element (index 0)
2. **Compare:** Check if current element equals the search key
3. **Found:** If match found, return the current index
4. **Continue:** If no match, move to the next element
5. **Repeat:** Continue steps 2-4 until element found or end reached
6. **Not Found:** If end reached without finding element, return -1

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(1) - Element found at first position
- Average Case: O(n/2) - Element found in middle
- Worst Case: O(n) - Element at end or not present

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only uses constant extra space

**Key Learning:** Understanding sequential access patterns, basic loop structures, and worst-case analysis when element is not present in the array.

### 2. Sequential Search Implementation

---

**File:** `Sequential_search.cpp`  
**Experiment ID:** SEARCH-02

**Description:** Alternative implementation of linear search algorithm demonstrating that Linear Search and Sequential Search are identical algorithms with different naming conventions. Both examine elements in sequential order.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Start:** Begin examination from first array element
2. **Sequential Check:** Examine each element in order
3. **Match Detection:** Compare current element with target value
4. **Position Return:** Return index if element matches target
5. **End Condition:** Continue until match found or array exhausted
6. **Failure Return:** Return -1 if target not found in entire array

**Comparison with Linear Search:**
- **Same Algorithm:** Identical implementation and logic flow
- **Same Complexity:** O(n) time complexity in worst case
- **Same Use Cases:** Works on unsorted arrays
- **Different Names:** Just different terminology for same concept

**Key Learning:** Understanding that algorithm names can vary while implementation remains identical, and recognizing fundamental search patterns.

### 3. Binary Search Algorithm

---

**File:** `Binary_search.cpp`  
**Experiment ID:** SEARCH-03

**Description:** Implements divide-and-conquer searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. Much more efficient than linear search for large sorted datasets.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Prerequisite:** Ensure array is sorted in ascending order
2. **Initialize:** Set left = 0, right = array_size - 1
3. **Calculate Middle:** Find middle index = left + (right - left) / 2
4. **Compare:** Check if middle element equals target
5. **Found:** If equal, return middle index
6. **Divide:** If target < middle, search left half (right = middle - 1)
7. **Conquer:** If target > middle, search right half (left = middle + 1)
8. **Repeat:** Continue steps 3-7 until element found or left > right
9. **Not Found:** Return -1 if search space exhausted

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(1) - Element found at middle position
- Average Case: O(log n) - Logarithmic reduction of search space
- Worst Case: O(log n) - Maximum logâ‚‚(n) comparisons needed

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space for iterative implementation

**Key Learning:** Understanding divide-and-conquer strategy, logarithmic time complexity, and the importance of sorted data for efficient searching algorithms.

int findContact(Contact phonebook[], int size, string name);

// Looking up word in dictionary (Binary Search)
int findWord(string dictionary[], int size, string word);

// Searching for file in directory (Sequential Search)
int findFile(File directory[], int size, string filename);

// Database record lookup (Hash-based or B-tree search)
Record* findRecord(Database db, int recordId);
```

## Testing Strategies:

- **Boundary Testing**: Test with first, last, and middle elements

- **Random Data Testing**: Test with various data distributions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid:

- **Array Bounds**: Accessing elements outside array boundaries
